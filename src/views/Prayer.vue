                    <div> We do not need to pray “if it be your will” prayers. We can be confident it is God’s will for trafficking and all evil associated with it to be annihilated. </div>

                    <div class="subtitle-1" style="text-align: left"> We say to the industry of trafficking, “Get ready to encounter this Glory-King! The Lord, armed and ready for battle, the Mighty One, invincible in every way!” (Psalm 24:7-8)
                    As we unite in prayer we are confident we will continually experience the immeasurable greatness of God’s power made available to us through faith. Our lives will be an advertisement of this immense power as it works through us! This is the mighty power that was released when God raised Christ from the dead and exalted him to the place of highest honor and supreme authority in the heavenly realm! And now he is exalted as first above every ruler, authority, government and realm of power in existence! He is gloriously enthroned over every name that is ever praised, not only in this age, but in the age that is coming!” (Ephesians 1:19-21)
                    Thank you, God, for this impenetrable wall of prayer you are creating over the issue of trafficking. May your peace and protection rest on those who have prayed before me. I claim your peace and protection over me and my family as I take my place on the wall. You look for people who will build up the wall and stand before you in the gap on behalf of those involved in trafficking - victims, perpetrators and those who fight against it. (Ezekiel 22:30) We say yes! We are those people. We are here to stand and declare your glory, absolutely believing you are unstoppable!

                    We stand in the place of our brothers and sisters who have been forced into slavery, stolen from their homes, or given out of desperation, and we cry out to you on their behalf. We hear them groan, desperate for freedom, until hopelessness and despair become their constant companions. We recognize the addiction to drugs many have had forced upon them and understand why they do not want to face the reality of their lives.
                    We declare you, God, see their misery. You hear them crying out because of those who hold them in slavery, and you are concerned about their suffering. Your word says you are the Rescuer, O God. We appeal to you, “Come and rescue your children!” (Exodus 3:7-8)
                    When they cry out to you, you hear, for you are compassionate. (Exodus 22:27) You are a God of incredible compassion. This is not a forgotten group of people. Their cries, their screams, their tears of desperation, their anger and their hopelessness are heard by you. Respond to their cries, Lord. Meet them in their dreams. Even in what appears to be an impossible situation in their minds, woo them with your love. Reveal yourself to each individual caught in this industry. Even in their captivity, Jesus, capture them with your love. 
                    Again, God, you said when people cry out to you, you hear them. Do not let them bear their misery any longer. Send your angels to bring them out. Cause the captives to be seen. Pave the way for their release, Lord. All over the world make those who are imprisoned obvious to those who can rescue them. Open doors for their release. We cry out to you, Almighty God, set the captives free! (Judges 10;16, Numbers 20:16, I Samuel 7:9)
                    We say to you, Lord, “You are our God!” Hear, Lord, our cries for mercy for those who have been trafficked. Sovereign Lord, you are the strong deliverer. Deliver them!  You shield our heads in the day of battle. Do not grant the wicked their desires, Lord; do not let their plans succeed…. You, Lord, secure justice for the poor and uphold the cause of the needy. We call on you to set the captives free! (Psalm 140:6-8, 12)
                    Calamity has come upon those who have been trafficked. You said whether calamity came through the sword, judgment, plague or famine, we can stand in your presence before the temple that bears your name, cry out to you in our distress and you will hear and save us. We stand in the gap for those who have been trafficked. In their place we come into your presence and cry out for them. You said you hear and save. Hear us and save those who have been trafficked, Lord! (2 Chronicles 20:9)
                    Whether or not they know you ... you, Lord, are their rock, their fortress and their deliverer. Be their rock, in whom they can take refuge, their shield and the horn of their salvation. You said you are their stronghold, their refuge and their savior. We decree you will save each trafficked person from violent men and women.
                    We call out to you for those held in slavery, Lord. You are worthy of praise, and we declare you will save them from those who hold them captive. Even though they feel waves of death, torrents of destruction, cords of the grave and snares of death all around them, you break through!
                    We cry out for each trafficked person. From your temple you hear our voices; our cries, mingled with their cries, come to your ears. The earth trembles and quakes. The foundations of the heavens shake; they tremble because you are angry. Smoke rises from your nostrils; consuming fire comes from your mouth, burning coals blaze out of it. You, God, part the heavens and come down; dark clouds are under your feet. You mount the cherubim and fly; you soar on the wings of the wind. You make darkness your canopy - the dark rain clouds of the sky.
                    Out of the brightness of your presence bolts of lightning blaze forth. You, Lord, thunder from heaven. Your voice resounds. You shoot your arrows and scatter the enemy. With great bolts of lightning you rout them. The valleys of the sea are exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, Lord, at the blast of breath from your nostrils. 
                    Reach down from on high and take hold of those held in slavery; draw them out of the deep waters of despair. Rescue each individual one from their powerful enemy, from their foes, who are too strong for them.
                    The enemy confronted and captured them on the day of their disaster, but you, Lord, are their support. Bring them out into a spacious place; rescue them because you delight in them and your heart is for them.
                    Your desire for each of them, Jesus, is righteousness; you want to show them how to be clean. Salvation, healing and wholeness are your reward for them.
                    We declare they will know your ways. They will turn to you. They will learn how you stood in their place so they can be blameless and pure before you. How you love each one of them! Be their lamp, Lord; turn their darkness into light.
                    We advance against the troops of the enemy with your help. Because of your majesty we scale this wall of evil, knowing your ways are perfect. Your word is flawless. You shield us as we take refuge in you and stand in the gap so those in captivity will be rescued and learn what refuge in you truly is.
                    Your way is perfect. Your word is flawless. You are their refuge. Who is God besides you, Lord? Who is the Rock except our God? Arm each trafficked individual with strength and create a perfect way for their escape. Open a path for their feet to walk away; enable them to clearly see it and give them victory in a successful escape from their captors.  (II Samuel 22:1-37)

                        We feel the pain of the friends and family members of those who have been trafficked and are enslaved. We declare you are the shepherd of a hundred lambs, and you take the time to search out each one who is lost. We decree you do not stop until you find each trafficked person, set them free and bring them to safety. (Luke 15:1-6)
                        Comfort each one missing a friend or family member by your counsel. Draw them closer to you. Lead them with your secret wisdom to find their loved ones. Whom do they have to rely on but you? Give them courage when they do not see answers. Keep bitterness and rage far from them, rather grow their trust in you. In spite of all they see in the natural realm, or do not see, lock their eyes on you. Birth faith in each friend and family member and cause it to grow. May their pain push them further into your heart. You endured the agony on the cross so they do not have to and now - NOW - you are seated at the right hand of the throne of God! You will win this battle and rescue those enslaved. (Hebrews 12:2)
                        We declare worship is their warfare and they worship you with all of their hearts. They know even though they live in the natural realm they do not wage a military campaign employing human weapons, using manipulation to achieve their aims. Instead, their spiritual weapons are energized with divine power to effectively dismantle the defenses behind which human traffickers hide. As we use our spiritual weapons we declare you dismantle the enemy’s schemes and bring our loved ones home. (2 Corinthians 10:4)
                        Open your ears to the pleas of your servants. Listen to these loved ones as they cry out to you and rescue their loved ones. Bring them out of captivity and into safety. (I Kings 8:52)
                        You do not despise deep cries of despair. You are the first responder to suffering and you do not look the other way when your people are in pain. You are there all the time, Lord, listening to the song of the afflicted.  (Psalm 22:24 TPT) We declare you see each one who is captured and are opening the way to their freedom.

                        How we thank you for those who spend their lives fighting against human trafficking. They are like the army of Gideon, a small but mighty group of people fighting a vast evil. As you said to Gideon we also believe you are saying to these people, “Go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands.” (Judges 7:9) We agree as you gave the Midianites to Joshua and his army you will give the trafficking industry to those fighting against it in your name.
                        God, you are the lamp. Be the lamp for those in the war against human trafficking. Turn the darkness into light and allow them to see those who are buying and selling people. (2 Samuel 22:29)
                        Draw each person who works for an anti-trafficking organization into your light. Be for them like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning or like the brightness after rain. Illuminate the world around them so they may be able to find those involved in trafficking and bring a stop to it.
                        Reveal the deep things of darkness and people involved in the trafficking industry. Bring utter darkness into the light. (Job 12:22)
                        Strengthen each of these people according to your word. (Psalm 119:28) Increase their power as they search out those who traffic others. May their hope in you rise up. Renew their strength. Cause them to soar on wings like eagles; to run and not grow weary, to walk and not faint. (Isaiah 40:29-31)

                        You are the Mighty One, clothed in splendor and majesty. In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility and justice; let your right hand, God, achieve awesome deeds. May your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of those perpetuating this evil industry. Cause the human trafficking rings to fall beneath your feet. Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore, God, let your justice and mercy bring down this evil in our world. (Psalm 45:3-7)
                        Reveal the deep things of darkness and people involved in the trafficking industry. Bring utter darkness into the light. (Job 12:22)
                        Pursue your enemies and crush the human trafficking industry. Do not turn back until it is destroyed. Crush it completely so it cannot rise. May it fall beneath your feet. 
                        Arm us with strength for battle and humble our adversaries before us. You make those who buy and sell others turn their backs in flight. You destroy your foes. They cry for help, but there is no one to save this industry. Beat this industry as fine as the dust of the earth; pound and trample it like mud in the streets. May each individual who buys and sells others lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds. (II Samuel 22:38-46)
                        At the same time our hearts cry out for justice to come to each of those who have bought and sold others, we also know mercy triumphs over judgment. You have judged the enemy of our souls and gained victory for each of us on the cross. Call these people into repentance, Lord. May they truly have a change of heart and turn to you. Your mercy triumphs over judgement. May they know eternal mercy even as they experience the judgment of earth.

You set captives free from their enemies. You exalt each individual as they come to know you; from violent men you rescue those who are enslaved.
                        Therefore we praise you, Lord, among the nations. We sing the praises of your name. You give us great victories. You show unfailing kindness to us and to those for whom we are praying. (II Samuel 22:47-51)
                        You will save each one who has been trafficked, God! We praise you in advance for gathering them and delivering them from captivity. We give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. Praise be to you, Lord, the God of each of us, from everlasting to everlasting. (I Chronicles 16:35-36)
                        We cut off any bitterness, rage, anger, slander, and all forms of negativity from this time of intercession. We close any opening to the enemy created in our spirits as we prayed. We lock them up and seal them with the blood of Jesus shed on the cross for each of us.
                        We release each person who has trafficked others or been involved in the human trafficking industry from our judgement and expections. We give up our right to judge them. Because of your love and the redemption you offer to each of them, woo them with your kindness. We bless and do not curse them. May your kindness lead to redemption for millions of people in the human trafficking industry. Let them be part of your billion soul harvest, leading to revival throughout the world!
                        Pour your anointing on those who are praying next. Surround them with a wall of holy fire as protection over each of them and those they love. We recognize we are joining heavenly forces in this unstoppable prayer movement. Keep each of us who have prayed, who are praying and who will pray safe physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally. We trust you and place our lives in your hands.

                        We say to you, Lord, “You are our God!” Hear, Lord, our cries for mercy for those who have been trafficked. Sovereign Lord, you are the strong deliverer. Deliver them!  You shield our heads in the day of battle. Do not grant the wicked their desires, Lord; do not let their plans succeed…. You, Lord, secure justice for the poor and uphold the cause of the needy. We call on you to set the captives free! (Psalm 140:6-8, 12)
                        Calamity has come upon those who have been trafficked. You said whether calamity came through the sword, judgment, plague or famine, we can stand in your presence before the temple that bears your name, cry out to you in our distress and you will hear and save us. We stand in the gap for those who have been trafficked. In their place we come into your presence and cry out for them. You said you hear and save. Hear us and save those who have been trafficked, Lord! (2 Chronicles 20:9)
                        Whether or not they know you ... you, Lord, are their rock, their fortress and their deliverer. Be their rock, in whom they can take refuge, their shield and the horn of their salvation. You said you are their stronghold, their refuge and their savior. We decree you will save each trafficked person from violent men and women.
                        We call out to you for those held in slavery, Lord. You are worthy of praise, and we declare you will save them from those who hold them captive. Even though they feel waves of death, torrents of destruction, cords of the grave and snares of death all around them, you break through!
                        We cry out for each trafficked person. From your temple you hear our voices; our cries, mingled with their cries, come to your ears. The earth trembles and quakes. The foundations of the heavens shake; they tremble because you are angry. Smoke rises from your nostrils; consuming fire comes from your mouth, burning coals blaze out of it. You, God, part the heavens and come down; dark clouds are under your feet. You mount the cherubim and fly; you soar on the wings of the wind. You make darkness your canopy - the dark rain clouds of the sky.
                        Out of the brightness of your presence bolts of lightning blaze forth. You, Lord, thunder from heaven. Your voice resounds. You shoot your arrows and scatter the enemy. With great bolts of lightning you rout them. The valleys of the sea are exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, Lord, at the blast of breath from your nostrils. 
                        Reach down from on high and take hold of those held in slavery; draw them out of the deep waters of despair. Rescue each individual one from their powerful enemy, from their foes, who are too strong for them.
                        The enemy confronted and captured them on the day of their disaster, but you, Lord, are their support. Bring them out into a spacious place; rescue them because you delight in them and your heart is for them.
                        Your desire for each of them, Jesus, is righteousness; you want to show them how to be clean. Salvation, healing and wholeness are your reward for them.
                        We declare they will know your ways. They will turn to you. They will learn how you stood in their place so they can be blameless and pure before you. How you love each one of them! Be their lamp, Lord; turn their darkness into light.
                        We advance against the troops of the enemy with your help. Because of your majesty we scale this wall of evil, knowing your ways are perfect. Your word is flawless. You shield us as we take refuge in you and stand in the gap so those in captivity will be rescued and learn what refuge in you truly is.
                        Your way is perfect. Your word is flawless. You are their refuge. Who is God besides you, Lord? Who is the Rock except our God? Arm each trafficked individual with strength and create a perfect way for their escape. Open a path for their feet to walk away; enable them to clearly see it and give them victory in a successful escape from their captors.  (II Samuel 22:1-37)

                            We feel the pain of the friends and family members of those who have been trafficked and are enslaved. We declare you are the shepherd of a hundred lambs, and you take the time to search out each one who is lost. We decree you do not stop until you find each trafficked person, set them free and bring them to safety. (Luke 15:1-6)
                            Comfort each one missing a friend or family member by your counsel. Draw them closer to you. Lead them with your secret wisdom to find their loved ones. Whom do they have to rely on but you? Give them courage when they do not see answers. Keep bitterness and rage far from them, rather grow their trust in you. In spite of all they see in the natural realm, or do not see, lock their eyes on you. Birth faith in each friend and family member and cause it to grow. May their pain push them further into your heart. You endured the agony on the cross so they do not have to and now - NOW - you are seated at the right hand of the throne of God! You will win this battle and rescue those enslaved. (Hebrews 12:2)
                            We declare worship is their warfare and they worship you with all of their hearts. They know even though they live in the natural realm they do not wage a military campaign employing human weapons, using manipulation to achieve their aims. Instead, their spiritual weapons are energized with divine power to effectively dismantle the defenses behind which human traffickers hide. As we use our spiritual weapons we declare you dismantle the enemy’s schemes and bring our loved ones home. (2 Corinthians 10:4)
                            Open your ears to the pleas of your servants. Listen to these loved ones as they cry out to you and rescue their loved ones. Bring them out of captivity and into safety. (I Kings 8:52)
                            You do not despise deep cries of despair. You are the first responder to suffering and you do not look the other way when your people are in pain. You are there all the time, Lord, listening to the song of the afflicted.  (Psalm 22:24 TPT) We declare you see each one who is captured and are opening the way to their freedom.

                            How we thank you for those who spend their lives fighting against human trafficking. They are like the army of Gideon, a small but mighty group of people fighting a vast evil. As you said to Gideon we also believe you are saying to these people, “Go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hands.” (Judges 7:9) We agree as you gave the Midianites to Joshua and his army you will give the trafficking industry to those fighting against it in your name.
                            God, you are the lamp. Be the lamp for those in the war against human trafficking. Turn the darkness into light and allow them to see those who are buying and selling people. (2 Samuel 22:29)
                            Draw each person who works for an anti-trafficking organization into your light. Be for them like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning or like the brightness after rain. Illuminate the world around them so they may be able to find those involved in trafficking and bring a stop to it.
                            Reveal the deep things of darkness and people involved in the trafficking industry. Bring utter darkness into the light. (Job 12:22)
                            Strengthen each of these people according to your word. (Psalm 119:28) Increase their power as they search out those who traffic others. May their hope in you rise up. Renew their strength. Cause them to soar on wings like eagles; to run and not grow weary, to walk and not faint. (Isaiah 40:29-31)

                            You are the Mighty One, clothed in splendor and majesty. In your majesty ride forth victoriously in the cause of truth, humility and justice; let your right hand, God, achieve awesome deeds. May your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of those perpetuating this evil industry. Cause the human trafficking rings to fall beneath your feet. Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore, God, let your justice and mercy bring down this evil in our world. (Psalm 45:3-7)
                            Reveal the deep things of darkness and people involved in the trafficking industry. Bring utter darkness into the light. (Job 12:22)
                            Pursue your enemies and crush the human trafficking industry. Do not turn back until it is destroyed. Crush it completely so it cannot rise. May it fall beneath your feet. 
                            Arm us with strength for battle and humble our adversaries before us. You make those who buy and sell others turn their backs in flight. You destroy your foes. They cry for help, but there is no one to save this industry. Beat this industry as fine as the dust of the earth; pound and trample it like mud in the streets. May each individual who buys and sells others lose heart and come trembling from their strongholds. (II Samuel 22:38-46)
                            At the same time our hearts cry out for justice to come to each of those who have bought and sold others, we also know mercy triumphs over judgment. You have judged the enemy of our souls and gained victory for each of us on the cross. Call these people into repentance, Lord. May they truly have a change of heart and turn to you. Your mercy triumphs over judgement. May they know eternal mercy even as they experience the judgment of earth.

You put this evil industry under your feet. You set captives free from their enemies. You exalt each individual as they come to know you; from violent men you rescue those who are enslaved.
                            Therefore we praise you, Lord, among the nations. We sing the praises of your name. You give us great victories. You show unfailing kindness to us and to those for whom we are praying. (II Samuel 22:47-51)
                            You will save each one who has been trafficked, God! We praise you in advance for gathering them and delivering them from captivity. We give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. Praise be to you, Lord, the God of each of us, from everlasting to everlasting. (I Chronicles 16:35-36)
                            We cut off any bitterness, rage, anger, slander, and all forms of negativity from this time of intercession. We close any opening to the enemy created in our spirits as we prayed. We lock them up and seal them with the blood of Jesus shed on the cross for each of us.
                            We release each person who has trafficked others or been involved in the human trafficking industry from our judgement and expections. We give up our right to judge them. Because of your love and the redemption you offer to each of them, woo them with your kindness. We bless and do not curse them. May your kindness lead to redemption for millions of people in the human trafficking industry. Let them be part of your billion soul harvest, leading to revival throughout the world!
                            Pour your anointing on those who are praying next. Surround them with a wall of holy fire as protection over each of them and those they love. We recognize we are joining heavenly forces in this unstoppable prayer movement. Keep each of us who have prayed, who are praying and who will pray safe physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally. We trust you and place our lives in your hands.
